# MonsterSafe
Monster Safe is a COVID-19 stat tracking interactinve front-end application built with HTML, CSS Bulma, and JavaScript. Here, users can compare and contrast COVID stats between different states to be better informed about potential infection rates when making domestic travel plans. We want to share information with the masses about COVID19. Our group wants to keep people up to date with the latest information from trusted sources, such as: Stanford Medicine Research Center, Harvard Global Health Institute and Georgetown University.
